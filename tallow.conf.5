.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This file is read on startup by the tallow(1) daemon, and can be used to provide options to the tallow daemon\. If not present, tallow will operate with built\-in defaults\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBipt_path\fR=\fB<string>\fR Specifies the location of the ipset(1), iptables(1) or ip6tables(1) program\. By default, tallow will look in "/usr/sbin" for them\.
.
.P
\fBexpires\fR=\fB<int>\fR The number of seconds that IP addresses are blocked for\. Note that due to the implementation, IP addresses may be blocked for much longer than this period\. If IP addresses are seen, but not blocked within this period, they are also removed from the watch list\. Defaults to 3600s\.
.
.P
\fBwhitelist\fR=\fB<ipv4 address>\fR Specify an IP address that should never be blocked\. Multiple IP addresses can be included by repeating the \fBwhitelist\fR option several times\. By default, only 127\.0\.0\.1 is whitelisted\.
.
.P
\fBipv6\fR=\fB<0|1>\fR Enable of disable ipv6 (ip6tables) support\. Ipv6 is disabled automatically on systems that do not appear to have ipv6 support and enabled when ipv6 is present\. Use this option to explicitly disable ipv6 support if your system does not have ipv6 or is missing ip6tables\. Even with ipv6 disabled, tallow will track and log ipv6 addresses\.
